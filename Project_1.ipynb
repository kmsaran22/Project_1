Iâ€™ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.\\n\\nWAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?\\n\\nWILL: Close as any man would.\\n\\nGARED: We should head back to the wall.\\n\\nROYCE: Do the dead frighten you?\\n\\nGARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They wonâ€™t trouble us no more.\\n\\nROYCE: You donâ€™t think heâ€™ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.\\n\\nWILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.\\n\\nROYCE: Itâ€™s a good thing weâ€™re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter â€¦ If I donâ€™t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I wonâ€™t say it again.\\n\\nROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.\\n\\nWILL: They were here.\\n\\nGARED: See where they went.\\n\\nROYCE: What is it?\\n\\nJON: Go on. Fatherâ€™s watching.\\n\\nJON: And your mother.\\n\\nSEPTA MORDANE: Fine work, as always. Well done.\\n\\nSANSA: Thank you.\\n\\nSEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that youâ€™ve managed to get in this corners.\\n\\nNED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.\\n\\nJON: Donâ€™t think too much, Bran.\\n\\nROBB: Relax your bow arm.\\n\\nCASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. Theyâ€™ve captured a deserter from the Nightâ€™s Watch.\\n\\nNED: Get the lads to saddle their horses.\\n\\nCATELYN: Do you have to?\\n\\nNED: He swore an oath, Cat.\\n\\nCASSEL: The law is law, my lady.\\n\\nNED: Tell Bran heâ€™s coming, too.\\n\\nCATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.\\n\\nNED: He wonâ€™t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.\\n\\nROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest.\\n\\nNED: King of the Andals and the First Men â€¦\\n\\nJON: Father will know if you do.\\n\\nNED: Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.\\n\\nJON: You did well.\\n\\nNED: You understand why I did it?\\n\\nBRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.\\n\\nNED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?\\n\\nBRAN: Our way is the old way?\\n\\nNED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.\\n\\nBRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?\\n\\nNED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.\\n\\nBRAN: So he was lying?\\n\\nNED: A madman sees what he sees.\\n\\nJON: What is it?\\n\\nTHEON: Mountain lion?\\n\\nNED: There are no mountain lions in these woods.\\n\\nTHEON: Itâ€™s a freak.\\n\\nNED: Itâ€™s a direwolf.\\n\\nNED: Tough old beast.\\n\\nROBB: There are no direwolves south of the Wall.\\n\\nJON: Now there are five.\\n\\nJON: You want to hold it?\\n\\nBRAN: Where will they go? Their motherâ€™s dead.\\n\\nCASSEL: They donâ€™t belong down here.\\n\\nNED: Better a quick death. They wonâ€™t last without their mother.\\n\\nTHEON: Right. Give it here.\\n\\nBRAN: NO!\\n\\nROBB: Put away your blade.\\n\\nTHEON: I take orders from your father, not you.\\n\\nBRAN: Please, father!\\n\\nNED: Iâ€™m sorry, Bran.\\n\\nJON: Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.\\n\\nNED: You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.\\n\\nBRAN: What about you?\\n\\nJON: Iâ€™m not a Stark. Get on.\\n\\nROBB: What is it?\\n\\nCERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?\\n\\nJAIME: But who would he tell?\\n\\nCERSEI: My husband.\\n\\nJAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didnâ€™t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while heâ€™s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.\\n\\nCERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.\\n\\nJAIME: Thatâ€™s an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.\\n\\nCATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.\\n\\nNED: You have five northern children. Youâ€™re not an outsider.\\n\\nCATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.\\n\\nNED: Itâ€™s your gods with all the rules.\\n\\nCATELYN: I am so sorry, my love.\\n\\nNED: Tell me.\\n\\nROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.\\n\\nTHEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.\\n\\nROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. Heâ€™s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.\\n\\nCATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast.\\n\\nBRAN: I saw the king! Heâ€™s got hundreds of people!\\n\\nCATELYN: How many times have I told you No climbing!\\n\\nBRAN: But heâ€™s coming right now! Down our road!\\n\\nCATELYN: I want you to promise me. No more climbing.\\n\\nNED: Your Grace.\\n\\nROBERT: Youâ€™ve got fat.\\n\\nROBERT: Cat!\\n\\nCATELYN: Your Grace.\\n\\nROBERT: Nine years. Why havenâ€™t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?\\n\\nNED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\\n\\nARYA: Whereâ€™s the Imp?\\n\\nSANSA: Will you shut up?\\n\\nROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb.\\n\\nARYA: Arya.\\n\\nROBERT: Ooh. Show us your muscles. Youâ€™ll be a soldier.\\n\\nARYA: Thatâ€™s Jaime Lannister. The queenâ€™s twin brother.\\n\\nSANSA: Would you please shut up.\\n\\nNED: My queen.\\n\\nCATELYN: My queen.\\n\\nROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.\\n\\nCERSEI: Weâ€™ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.\\n\\nROBERT: Ned.\\n\\nARYA: Whereâ€™s the Imp?\\n\\nCERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.\\n\\nNED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.\\n\\nROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then â€¦ Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.\\n\\nNED: We both did.\\n\\nROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me â€¦ You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.\\n\\nNED: Aye.\\n\\n'"
